# Caliro Project Website

The official website for Caliro, an open-source mobile OS focused on mindful technology use. This project aims to create a mobile operating system that prioritizes user well-being over engagement metrics, featuring thoughtful design patterns and tools to help users develop a healthier relationship with their devices.

Built with Astro and deployed on GitHub Pages. The site showcases the project's vision, approach, and community involvement opportunities for building technology that serves users rather than exploiting them.
