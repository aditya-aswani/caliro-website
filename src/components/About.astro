      <p>
        Hi, I'm <a href="https://adityaaswani.com" target="_blank">Aditya</a>, and I'm building Caliro because I've been there. I've felt the pull 
        of the infinite scroll, the anxiety of notification badges, and the shame of realizing 
        hours have vanished into a screen.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I've tried many app blockers, digital wellness tools, and techniques. They help, 
        but they're fighting against a system that's fundamentally designed to win. That's when 
        I realized: we need to change the system itself.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Caliro is my attempt to create what I wish existed - a phone operating system that's 
        on your side. Not trying to monetize your attention, not trying to keep you hooked, 
        just helping you use technology in a way that aligns with your values and goals.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        This is a FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) project because I want this to be as accessible as possible. It belongs to all of us who want to reclaim our 
        relationship with technology.
